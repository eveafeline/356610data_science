    "We often make predictions in life based upon our past experience. For example, if for 35 hourses sold in a town in the lsat month, we known their sold prices and their features(bedrooms, bathrooms, ot size, living space, age, quality of construction, etc.), we may be able to predict sold price of another house that just came on for sale with some confidence. In this case, the data that we have is called training examples (in this example, we have 35 training examples).\n",

    "Let us assume we have m training examples [y, X], X = { x1, x2, x3, ... xn]. Here the variable y is dependent on a set of n independent features where, by wat of the example, y can be price of a house, and X represents its features such as square footage, lot size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, age, quality of construction, etc. The problem of Linear Regression consists of finding a line that fits best to m points in the n-dimensional hyperspace which, in other words, means finding n+1 parameters w1, w2, w3, ... , wN and b given a set of m training exampls"
